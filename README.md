## Final Outputs :potato:

The final outputs, as specified by the brief, are:

- [design PDF](design/index.pdf)
- [implemnentation](implementation)

### Bonus :gem:

Additional deliverables completed:

- [Design docs hosted as Github Page](https://angry-potato.github.io/go-pay-me/)
- [Automation](.travis.yml)
- [Dev journal](JOURNAL.md)
- [Implementation Deployed to Heroku](https://go-pay-me.herokuapp.com/payments)
- [Swagger2PDF](https://github.com/Angry-Potato/swagger2pdf)

## Design :computer:

The design directory contains [the API design](design/payments.swagger.json) in `swagger.json` format, as well as the resulting [PDF](design/index.pdf) as specified in the brief, a copy of the original payments payload example, some swagger2pdf config, and a Makefile to encapsulate the PDF generation.

The PDF, asciidoc, and HTML docs are all autogenerated from the `payments.swagger.json`. This is done using an `npm script` called `regen-docs` in the root of the repository.

### Docs :scroll:

As mentioned above, the docs under the [docs](docs) directory are autogenerated from the [payments.swagger.json](design/payments.swagger.json) using an `npm script`.

To run the generation yourself, clone the repo, cd to the root of it, and install the `node_modules` via:

    yarn # or `npm i` depending on your tool preference

Then run the script using:

    yarn regen-docs # or `npm run regen-docs`

The [docs](docs) dir now contains up-to-date HTML docs based on the [payments.swagger.json](design/payments.swagger.json), and the design dir contains up-to-date PDF and asciidocs.
